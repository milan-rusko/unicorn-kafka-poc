# Tableau

Tableau Online and Tableau Server provide number of data source connectors. I've tried a trial version 
of Tableau Online with connection to a testing PostgreSQL database. It means we are able to create a data
source for Tableau reporting, more detailed request specification is needed to do a further research.

All I can say now is that we are able to integrate our products with the Tableau products.
